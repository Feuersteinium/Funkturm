## MONTHLY FILE GEN
## DATE PLOTTER

## Constants

monthm = ["Januar", "Februar", "MÃ¤rz", "April", "Mai", "Juni", "Juli", "August", "September", "Oktober", "November", "Dezember"]

## Functions

def input_year():
    try:
        return(int(input("What year is it? \n  >> ")))
    except ValueError:
        print("The given year isnt a valid integer, exiting...")
        exit()

## This function takes a year as an input and will output a list with the lenght of each month in days. Important for leap years

def generate_month_lenght(year):
    monthd = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31]
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 !=0) or year % 400 == 0:
               monthd[1] = 29
    return(monthd)

## Parameters
## year = year
## mlist == month list (List with the lenght of each month)

        runner += 1

        # We can't start at 0 as usual, as the first day of the month would be day 0.(starting at 1 and ending at n+1 instead of starting at 0 and ending at n.)
        for x in range(1,element +1):

            ## THIS WILL CHECK IF IT NEED TO ADD A 0
            ## IF IT DOESNT, DAYFINAL WILL BE REWRITTEN TO STRING

            else:

            f.write("[[" + dayfinal + "-" + monthfinal + "-" + str(year) + "]]" + "\n")
    f.close()


## Run everything :D

yr = input_year()
yearmap(yr, generate_month_lenght(yr))
